# Sales_Tracker #


## Current Vision ##
This will be a website where users can create an account and use this as a website to track any sales or deals on a variety of items (clothes, video games, electronics, maybe even resorts or food, etc.). There is no easy way to track items across multiple sites, or compare prices. This idea will enable that, along with provide users updates via either email or phone number (or both) of prices across various platforms.  

## Things to look into ##
1. Front End
  * Most likely a React.JS front end 
  * Ensure that it's Mobile Friendly
  * Create Username/Password system
  * Pages for homepage, profiles, how to add items, searching (maybe), etc.
  * Notification System?
2. Back End
  * AWS for storing user information and data on items (We could also just use a MERN stack, but AWS seems like a good skill to have)
  * Look into different shopping APIs (Macy's, Steam, Best Buy, etc.)
  * Create our own API to abstract the independent shopping API calls
  * Notification System(?). Maybe even add Twilio API if possible. Email API works too.

## Things to research ##
 * What shopping APIs we have available
   * How often can we ping them?
 * Learn about how to configure AWS OR look into creating a MERN stack for our application
 * Learn about best ways to store login credentials
 * How to use React.JS to make mobile friendly websites
 * Mobile app development if it\'s an interest
 * Use Flask/Django to create our own API for front-to-backend communications
